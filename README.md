# Plumb

**Plumb** is a planned iPhone-first strength-training companion. Put the phone where its camera can see a supported exercise, do a set, and review one specific observation linked to the movement it saw. Try another set and compare. The product is designed to say when the view is too weak to support a cue.

The iPhone is the core experience. Apple Watch workout data and spoken feedback through AirPods are optional additions. Apple Foundation Models may help phrase validated observations on eligible devices; the coaching facts come from camera pose analysis and exercise-specific rules, with a non-generative fallback. Plumb is a fitness aid, not medical advice or a guarantee of safe technique.

**Current state (10 October 2026):** this repository contains the renamed Xcode starter app, a new Plumb icon, brand assets, and the product plan. The visible app screen introduces the concept. Camera analysis, Watch integration, coaching, subscriptions, and workout history are not implemented. The challenge goal is a tested iPhone camera-to-cue prototype for a side-view bodyweight squat; public release has a separate validation gate.

Project for the October 2026 Build Challenge: Unaite, MWM, Apple & ⌘+F.
